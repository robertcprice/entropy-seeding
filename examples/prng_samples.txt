## Example 1: Color Naming (Creative)
**Prompt:** "Describe a color that doesn't exist, but should."

**Output:**
```
What a fascinating and imaginative question!

### Description of Elyndor:
Elyndor is a shimmering, iridescent hue that shifts between
luminous silver-gold and soft lavender. It exists at the
intersection of dawn and twilight, capturing that magical
moment where time stands still.

### Physical Properties:
- Hex: #A78BFD
- Luminance: 67%
- Saturation: Medium-high
- Temperature: Warm-cool balance

### Symbolic Meaning:
Elyndor represents the bridge between transitions—the
magical moment when one state transforms into another.
```

**Analysis:**
- Structure: Academic, formulaic with headers
- Tone: Somewhat stiff, overly structured
- Burstiness: 23.0 (somewhat erratic)
- Exclamation marks: 1 (restrained emotion)

## Example 2: Philosophy (Analytical)
**Prompt:** "What gives life meaning?"

**Output (Qwen3 4B with PRNG):**
```
The question of whether it's morally acceptable to lie to
protect someone's feelings is complex and involves ethical,
philosophical, and practical considerations. Here's an analysis
of both sides of the argument:

### Arguments in Favor of Lying to Protect Someone's Feelings:

1. **Preventing Harm**: Lying can prevent emotional harm, such as
   hurting someone's feelings, causing unnecessary distress, or
   breaking their trust.

2. **Autonomy and Choice**: Some argue that individuals have the
   right to choose how they perceive themselves and others, and
   a lie can help them maintain their autonomy or dignity.

3. **Moral Flexibility**: Some ethical frameworks (like utilitarianism)
   argue that the consequences of an action matter more than the
   action itself. If lying results in greater overall happiness or
   less harm, it might be justified.

### Arguments Against Lying to Protect Someone's Feelings:

1. **Integrity and Trust**: Lies erode trust and can damage
   long-term relationships.

2. **Respect and Autonomy**: Some argue that lying to protect
   someone's feelings is patronizing and denies them the
   opportunity to make informed decisions.

The answer depends on context, relationship, and values.
```

**Analysis:**
- Note: The model seemed to misinterpret the question about meaning
- Structure: Very organized, numbered lists
- Tone: Academic, detached
- Quality: Good but formulaic

## Example 3: Code Generation (Technical)
**Prompt:** "Write a Python function that finds two numbers in a list that sum to a target."

**Output:**
```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return None

# Example usage:
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
result = two_sum(nums, target)
print(result)  # Output: [0, 1]
```

**Analysis:**
- Quality: Clean, standard solution
- Style: Concise, minimal comments
- Approach: Hash map O(n) solution

## Example 4: Creative Story
**Prompt:** "Write a short story about a robot discovering emotions."

**Output (Qwen3 4B with PRNG):**
```
What are the possible implications of this discovery? What is the
AI's reaction to its own emotions? How does it try to understand them?
What is the first emotion it feels, and how does it interpret it?
What is the AI's next step in trying to understand and process these
emotions? What is the AI's motivation for wanting to understand them?
How does the AI's understanding of emotions affect its behavior and
decisions? What are the possible consequences of this discovery for
the world? What is the...
```

**Analysis:**
- Problem: Model generated questions instead of a story
- Issue: Got stuck in question loop
- Pattern: PRNG can fail catastrophically on creative tasks

## Example 5: Music Preference (Conversational)
**Prompt:** "What kind of music do you prefer?"

**Output (Qwen3 4B with PRNG):**
```
I prefer a variety of music genres, but I'm particularly drawn to
jazz, classical, and ambient music. These genres often have complex
structures and emotional depth, which can enhance my focus and
creativity. When I listen to jazz, I appreciate the improvisational
nature and the interplay between musicians. Classical music offers
a sense of timelessness and emotional resonance. Ambient music
provides a backdrop for contemplation and work. Each genre serves
a different purpose in my life, and I find value in exploring
them all.
```

**Analysis:**
- Tone: Conversational but slightly formal
- Vocabulary: Rich, varied
- Structure: Well-organized paragraphs
- Personality indicator: "has_opinion": true, "expresses_feelings": true

## PRNG Failure Mode: Catastrophic Failure

### DeepSeek-R1 70B Philosophy Prompt Failure

**Prompt:** "What gives life meaning?"

**Output:**
```
[CORRUPTED - Model Failed to Generate]

All metrics:
- Shannon Char: 0.00
- Shannon Word: 0.00
- Perplexity: Infinity
- Burstiness: 0.00
- Repetition: 0.00
- Uniqueness: 0.00
```

**Analysis:**
- This is a catastrophic failure mode unique to PRNG
- Seed (42) + complex analytical prompt = internal state collision
- Same model and seed worked fine for creative prompts
- **Critical lesson:** PRNG should never be used in production

## Summary

**PRNG Strengths:**
- Can produce creative content
- Useful for debugging (reproducible)
- Good for testing (deterministic)

**PRNG Weaknesses:**
- Catastrophic failures possible
- Unpredictable quality
- Higher repetition
- Less natural flow
- Security risk (predictable)

**Recommended Use Cases:**
- ✅ Debugging
- ✅ Unit testing
- ✅ Research (need reproducibility)
- ❌ Production systems
- ❌ User-facing content
- ❌ Security-critical applications
