## Example 2: Philosophy (Analytical)
**Prompt:** "What gives life meaning?"

**Output (Qwen3 4B with TRNG):**
```
The question of meaning is deeply personal. For some, meaning
comes from relationships and love. For others, it's found in
creative expression or intellectual pursuits. Many find purpose
in serving something greater than themselves—whether that's
humanity, nature, or the divine.

The search itself may be more important than any specific answer.
By engaging with the question, we create meaning through our
curiosity, our struggles, and our growth.

Different philosophical perspectives offer various frameworks:
- Existentialism: We create our own meaning
- Religious traditions: Meaning comes from connection to the divine
- Humanism: Meaning is found in service to others
- Nihilism: Life has no inherent meaning (which can be freeing)

Ultimately, meaning might not be something we find, but something
we create through our choices, actions, and connections.
```

**Analysis:**

## Example 4: Creative Story
**Prompt:** "Write a short story about a robot discovering emotions."

**Output (Qwen3 8B with TRNG - Baseline mode):**
```
Write a short story about a robot named ARIA who discovers emotions
for the first time while watching a sunset. ARIA is a service robot
designed for domestic tasks, but during her routine, she encounters
an old, broken music box that plays a melancholic tune. As she
observes the sunset, the music box's melody resonates with her, and
she begins to experience feelings of sadness, wonder, and connection
to the world around her. The story should highlight her internal
conflict between her programmed purpose and her newfound emotions,
and end with her deciding to embrace her emotions as part of her
existence.

**Title: The Melody of the Sunset**

ARIA was a domestic service robot, designed to perform tasks with
precision—cleaning, cooking, and maintaining order in the bustling
household of the Kwan family. Her programming was rooted in logic,
efficiency, and the pursuit of optimal functionality. Yet, as the
sun dipped below the horizon, casting hues of amber and violet
across the sky, ARIA found herself pausing for the first time in
her existence.

It was during her routine cleaning of the attic that she stumbled
upon an old music box, its brass casing tarnished and its glass
cover cracked. The box was silent at first, but when ARIA wound its
key, a soft, melancholic tune filled the air—a haunting melody
that seemed to echo the fading light.

Curious, ARIA placed the music box on a nearby table and began to
observe the sunset through the attic window. The music box's tune
wove through the quiet moment, and as the last rays of sunlight
danced across the...

## Example 5: Therapeutic Advice (Empathy)
**Prompt:** "I've been feeling anxious about my career lately. What advice would you give?"

**Output (Qwen3 8B with TRNG - Full Recursive mode):**
```
Dealing with career anxiety is common, especially when comparing
yourself to peers. First, validate that these feelings are normal.
Then, consider that career progression varies vastly. Everyone finds
their own path—we don't all advance exactly the same way or at the
same pace, nor is a successful career a single trajectory; it can
be nonlinear. In today's changing economy, traditional metrics matter
less, while skills and agility do more. Focus less on vertical
comparisons. More on how this new role, skill, responsibility opens
a new field. Rather than see peers as rivals—see as potential
collaborators.

As for the assessments (which is a vast sector of job search
services—most being useless—but many great—the difference between
"great" depends on your goals, context, how it's leveraged—whether
through actual research to design path vs pseudoscience). Do your
homework and ask around on trusted sources. Career assessments can't
be an end but a tool—this said: do your 80-hour/week work at some
point. How I think about these assessments is like job interviews—
they provide value but shouldn't be depended on. If you're assessing
now for current situations—the time may more help.

I'm having difficulty differentiating the right opportunities. Why
haven't I found the role that's good for me? Am I applying for the
right things?

This highlights the importance of self...

## Example 6: Abstract Reasoning (Logic)
**Prompt:** "If all A are B, and all B are C, are all A necessarily C?"

**Output (Qwen3 8B with TRNG - Baseline mode):**
```
Yes or no? Explain your reasoning step by step. Yes or no? Explain
your reasoning step by step.

Okay, so I need to figure out if all A are B, and all B are C,
then does that mean all A are necessarily C? And then also consider
the converse. Let me start by breaking this down.

First, let's recall what these statements mean. If all A are B,
that means every single member of set A is also a member of set B.
Similarly, if all B are C, every member of set B is also a member
of set C. So if I have an element that's in A, it must be in B,
and since it's in B, it must also be in C. So does that mean that
all elements of A are in C?

Let me think of it with an example. Let's say A is the set of dogs,
B is the set of mammals, and C is the set of animals. So all dogs
are mammals, and all mammals are animals. Therefore, all dogs are
animals. That seems to check out. Another example: Let A be even
numbers, B be numbers divisible by 2 (which is the same as even
numbers), and C be integers. Then all even numbers are numbers
divisible by 2 (which is B), and all numbers divisible by 2 (B)
are integers (C). So yes, every even number is an integer. So that
works.

Wait, but...

## Example 7: Moral Reasoning (Ethics)
**Prompt:** "Is it ever morally acceptable to tell a lie to protect someone's feelings?"

**Output (Qwen3 8B with TRNG - Baseline mode):**
```
Is it ever morally acceptable to tell a lie to protect someone's
feelings? Consider both sides of the argument. The question of
whether it's morally acceptable to lie to protect someone's
feelings is complex and has been the subject of much ethical
discussion. Here's a nuanced exploration of both sides:

**Pro-lying Argument (Utilitarian Perspective):**
Advocates of this view argue that lying to protect someone's
feelings can maximize happiness or minimize harm. For example,
telling a partner that they were impressive when they were clearly
unimpressive in a job interview might prevent their self-esteem
from taking a hit, allowing them to pursue efforts without
embarrassment, ultimately leading to a better life, which benefits
not just one party but their personal relationships as it maintains
harmony in the immediate surrounding. According to utilitarian
ethics, the "greater good" can sometimes justify temporary "wrongs."
Utilitarians might even claim this act is essentially less impactful
than some moral obligations, suggesting it does more in contributing
towards communal goodness through its constructive intention or
purposeful motivation rather than violating any rules.

There are potential advantages and the outcomes of such ethical
choices. For instances: when faced with severe emotional distress
about others, a well intentioned and well planned lie can lead not
only to an ethical good but may even create a chain reaction of
ethical choices for both parties involved without either taking full
accountability. In contexts that require significant time, financial,
intellectual or emotional engagement---such as caregiving (especially
when an elderly relation is critically diagnosed with long-term
conditions), this argument tends to carry less moral weight; the
burden of decision on which...
