But now, when he looked at the sea floor, he could see something that wasn't there before. It was a strange shape, and it looked like it was moving. The old lighthouse keeper was terrified. He ran to the village and told everyone what he had seen. The villagers were skeptical at first, but then they all went to look at the sea floor.",
