## Appendix: Metrics Glossary & Interpretation Guide

### Metrics Used in This Report

| Metric | Full Name | Range | Interpretation |
|--------|-----------|-------|----------------|
| **shannon_char** | Character-level Shannon entropy | 0 -- 4.7 bits | Measures the information density of individual characters in the output. Higher values indicate more varied character usage (more uniform distribution across the alphabet, punctuation, etc.). Values near 4.7 approach the theoretical maximum for printable ASCII. Values below 4.0 suggest repetitive character patterns. |
| **shannon_word** | Word-level Shannon entropy | 0 -- 12 bits | Measures the information density of the word distribution. Higher values indicate a broader active vocabulary in the output. This metric is sensitive to output length: longer outputs tend to have higher word entropy because more unique words appear. Typical LLM outputs range from 6.0 to 8.5 bits. |
| **word_diversity** | Type-Token Ratio (TTR) | 0 -- 1 | Calculated as unique_words / total_words. Higher values indicate more lexically diverse output with less word repetition. Unlike shannon_word, TTR is inversely correlated with length (longer texts naturally reuse more words), so comparisons are most meaningful when length_words values are similar across conditions. Values above 0.7 indicate high diversity; below 0.5 suggests significant repetition. |
| **length_words** | Output length in words | 0 -- unbounded | A control metric measuring the total word count of the generated output. This is not a quality metric per se, but is essential for interpreting the other metrics. Differences in length between entropy conditions (PRNG, TRNG, QRNG) can confound shannon_word and word_diversity comparisons. When length varies substantially across conditions for a given prompt, interpret diversity metrics with caution. |

### Entropy Source Conditions

| Condition | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **PRNG** | Pseudorandom number generator (deterministic, algorithmic randomness). Serves as the baseline/control condition. |
| **TRNG** | True random number generator (hardware-based thermal/atmospheric noise). Non-deterministic physical randomness. |
| **QRNG** | Quantum random number generator (quantum vacuum fluctuation-based). Theoretically the highest-quality entropy source. |

### Reading the Results Tables

Each table shows the **mean value** across 5 samples per condition for a given prompt. When comparing across entropy conditions (PRNG vs TRNG vs QRNG):

- **Small differences** (e.g., shannon_char varying by < 0.05) are likely within normal generation variance and should not be interpreted as meaningful effects of the entropy source.
- **Consistent directional trends** across multiple prompts are more informative than any single prompt comparison.
- **length_words** should be checked first: if one condition produces substantially longer or shorter outputs, the other metrics may shift as a consequence of length rather than entropy quality.

### Model-Specific Note: Gemma 3

Google's Gemma 3 uses a hybrid attention architecture combining **local sliding-window attention** with **global attention** at periodic layers. The local attention mechanism processes tokens within a fixed context window, while global attention layers aggregate information across the full sequence. This architecture may make Gemma 3 particularly sensitive to early-token randomness from the entropy seed, as local attention patterns in the initial layers directly shape short-range token dependencies before global layers integrate broader context. The relatively consistent output patterns observed across entropy conditions may reflect Gemma 3's strong regularization through its alternating attention structure.
