The old man had been keeping watch for hours when he noticed something strange. It was a light, but not a normal one. It was a soft, golden glow that seemed to float in the air. He stepped closer, his footfalls echoing in the stillness. The light was getting brighter, and it was moving. It was coming towards him. He could feel it. He felt a strange pull,",
