## Appendix: Metrics Glossary & Interpretation Guide

### Metrics Used in This Report

| Metric | Full Name | Range | Interpretation |
|--------|-----------|-------|----------------|
| **shannon_char** | Character-level Shannon entropy | 0 -- 4.7 bits | Measures the information density of individual characters in the output. Higher values indicate more varied character usage (more uniform distribution across the alphabet, punctuation, etc.). Values near 4.7 approach the theoretical maximum for printable ASCII. Values below 4.0 suggest repetitive character patterns. |
| **shannon_word** | Word-level Shannon entropy | 0 -- 12 bits | Measures the information density of the word distribution. Higher values indicate a broader active vocabulary in the output. This metric is sensitive to output length: longer outputs tend to have higher word entropy because more unique words appear. Typical LLM outputs range from 6.0 to 8.5 bits. |
| **word_diversity** | Type-Token Ratio (TTR) | 0 -- 1 | Calculated as unique_words / total_words. Higher values indicate more lexically diverse output with less word repetition. Unlike shannon_word, TTR is inversely correlated with length (longer texts naturally reuse more words), so comparisons are most meaningful when length_words values are similar across conditions. Values above 0.7 indicate high diversity; below 0.5 suggests significant repetition. |
| **length_words** | Output length in words | 0 -- unbounded | A control metric measuring the total word count of the generated output. This is not a quality metric per se, but is essential for interpreting the other metrics. Differences in length between entropy conditions (PRNG, TRNG, QRNG) can confound shannon_word and word_diversity comparisons. When length varies substantially across conditions for a given prompt, interpret diversity metrics with caution. |

### Entropy Source Conditions

| Condition | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **PRNG** | Pseudorandom number generator (deterministic, algorithmic randomness). Serves as the baseline/control condition. |
| **TRNG** | True random number generator (hardware-based thermal/atmospheric noise). Non-deterministic physical randomness. |
| **QRNG** | Quantum random number generator (quantum vacuum fluctuation-based). Theoretically the highest-quality entropy source. |

### Reading the Results Tables

Each table shows the **mean value** across 5 samples per condition for a given prompt. When comparing across entropy conditions (PRNG vs TRNG vs QRNG):

- **Small differences** (e.g., shannon_char varying by < 0.05) are likely within normal generation variance and should not be interpreted as meaningful effects of the entropy source.
- **Consistent directional trends** across multiple prompts are more informative than any single prompt comparison.
- **length_words** should be checked first: if one condition produces substantially longer or shorter outputs, the other metrics may shift as a consequence of length rather than entropy quality.
- **[TIMEOUT] entries** indicate that the model failed to produce a complete response within the allotted generation time. These missing data points reduce the effective sample size for that condition and prompt.

### Model-Specific Note: Phi-4 Mini

Microsoft's Phi-4 Mini is a compact model from the Phi series, designed for efficiency with a relatively small parameter count while maintaining strong reasoning capabilities. Phi-4 Mini uses a dense transformer architecture with grouped-query attention (GQA) and was trained on a carefully curated mixture of synthetic and web data. The multiple [TIMEOUT] entries observed in this report (particularly in multi-turn debate sequences) reflect the model's tendency toward verbose, structured responses that can exceed generation time limits. The notably higher word_diversity values compared to larger models (frequently 0.7--0.85) may partly reflect shorter average output lengths, as TTR is inversely correlated with text length. The high variance in length_words across conditions (e.g., 194 vs 396 words for the same prompt) suggests that Phi-4 Mini's generation length is more sensitive to entropy seed variation than larger models, which warrants caution when interpreting the accompanying diversity metrics.
